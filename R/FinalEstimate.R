## * FinalEstimate (documentation)
#' @title calculate de-biased estimate
#'
#' @param Info.d Information at all decision analyses up to stage where study was stopped (should include information at final analysis if stopped at final analysis)
#' @param Info.i Information at all interim analyses up to stage where study was stopped
#' @param ck,ck.unrestricted decision boundaries for all decision analyses up to stage where study was stopped (should include final boundary if stopped at final analysis).
#' ck is possibly with restriction (when cNotBelowFixedc=TRUE) and ck.unrestricted always without.
#' @param lk lower bounds up to stage where study was stopped
#' @param uk upper bounds up to stage where study was stopped
#' @param reason.interim motivation for stopping or continuing at interim. Use to handle special cases (skipped interim because reach Imax, ...)
#' @param kMax maximum number of analyses
#' @param estimate naive estimate (e.g. using  ML or REML).
#' @param statistic naive test statistic (e.g. using  ML or REML).
#' @param method  method 1, 2 or 3
#' @param bindingFutility [logical]  whether the futility stopping rule is binding.
#' @param cNotBelowFixedc [logical] whether the value c at the decision analysis can be below that of a fixed sample test (H & J page 10)
#' @param continuity.correction [logical] whether to add the probability of stopping between ck and ck.uncorrected to ensure continuity of the p-value across stages.
#' When used the p-value will always be greater than this probability of stopping bettwen ck and ck.uncorrected.
#' @param tolerance [numeric] acceptable discrepancy to the objective level when evaluating the confidence intervals and median unbiased estimate.
